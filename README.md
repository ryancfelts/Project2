# Project2

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Project Proposal

Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:

* The kind of data you'd like to work with and the field you're interested in (e.g., trading, quantitative analysis).

* Possible source for such data.

* Candidate machine learning or statistical models that you may want to explore.

> Our project is to predict credit card fraud. We'll fit a random forest algorithm to lending club data to create a predictive model. We will also fit a deep neural network model to the data and compare the performance of both models to determine which has sufficient predictive power.

## Finding Data

Once your group has written an outline, it's time to start hunting for data. You are free to use data from any source, but we recommend the following curated sources of high-quality data:

* [data.world](https://data.world/)

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

* [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov)

* [Public APIs](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)

* [Awesome-APIs List](https://github.com/Kikobeats/awesome-api)

* [Medium APIs List](https://medium.com/@benjamin_libor/a-curated-collection-of-over-150-apis-to-build-great-products-fdcfa0f361bc)

Chances are you'll have to update your Project Outline as you explore the available data. This is fineâ€”adjustments like this are part of the process! Just make sure everyone in the group is up to speed on the goals of the project as you make changes.

Make sure that your data is not too large for local analysis. Big-data datasets are difficult to manage locally, so consider a subset of that data or a different dataset altogether.

## Data Preparation & Model Training

Machine learning typically requires extensive data preparation before the model can be trained. Use Jupyter, Google Colab, or AWS SageMaker to prepare a training and testing dataset and to train the machine-learning model.

Use the training data to fit the model.

## Model Evaluation

Use the testing data to evaluate the model. Create any necessary tables, charts, plots, or statistical analysis to report the model performance.

## Predictions and Conclusions

Summarize your conclusions and predictions. This should include a numerical summary (what data your model yielded), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final model evaluation and predictions).

Optionally, deploy the model as an interactive dashboard or interface (Lex or SageMaker).

Finally, be sure that your projects meet the [technical requirements](TechnicalRequirements.md).

## Presentation

After you've tweaked your model to your satisfaction, you'll put together a presentation to show off your work, explain your process, and discuss your conclusions.

This presentation will be delivered as a slideshow, and it should give your classmates and instructional staff an overview of your work. PowerPoint, Keynote, and Google Slides are all acceptable for building slides.

As long as your slides meet the [presentation requirements](PresentationRequirements.md), you are free to structure the presentation however you wish, but students are often successful with the format laid out in the [presentation guidelines](PresentationGuidelines.md).

## Submission

In addition to submitting your project on Bootcamp Spot individually, please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/CBk5tyy4sSsGN8k38) **once per group**.

## Contributing
Francene, Ryan and Murthy contributed to this project apart from invaluable guidance from Instructors: Steve and Kowsi. We also would like to thank all the other students in our class for all the interactions and creative ideas that made this possible.


## Licencing
No licencing requirements exists for this version of the project deliverables

# Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for Project 2 are as follows.

* [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab Notebook, or Amazon SageMaker Notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.

* [ ] Optionally, apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.

* [ ] Create one or more machine learning models.

* [ ] Fit the model(s) to the training data.

* [ ] Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.

* [ ] Show the predictions using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.

* [ ] Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.

* [ ] Use one new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric that hasn't been covered in class.

* [ ] Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
